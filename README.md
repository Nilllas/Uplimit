## Week 1: Introduction to Large Language Models

Over the course of this week, you'll be introduced to Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT. You'll learn how they are trained and what makes them so much more performant (and valuable!) than older language models like BERT. We'll also dive deeper into the OpenAI ecosystem and capabilities and provide a short overview of how to use them so that you feel ready to tackle the project.

### Week 1 - Project: Podcast Summarization Service

In the project, we will help you build an end-to-end service that summarizes and highlights your favorite podcasts, so that you can then choose which ones to actually listen to. We're excited to see how you extend the project to build your own product!
